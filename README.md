# Simple E-Commerce Website

This is a simple Ecommerce website, still in a very rough shape in the early stages of programming. 
I like to learn by doing so that is what I am doing here. 

I am using React with Bootstrap styling for the Front-End and Strapi for the Back-End.

To start the Project, firstly navigate to the backend Folder, then 

```bash
npm run dev
```

And the frontend:

```bash
npm run start
```
